		<p>Henry Clay Frick made a fortune in coke, an ingredient essential to making steel. While Pittsburgh's wealthy industrialists enjoyed comfort and leisure, the bulk of Pittsburgh's residents toiled long days in dirty, dangerous mills for paltry wages.</p> 
		<p>By 1908, Frick wanted his only surviving daughter, Helen, to have an elaborate social debut at the Vanderbilt mansion, the largest private residence ever built in New York City. He was outraged when Helen said she wanted a simple affair with old friends back in Pittsburgh. As the big New York party drew near, Helen and her mother sneaked onto a train to Pittsburgh and made plans for the coming out party that Helen wanted. She won her father over with this handwritten message on an invitation like this one.</p>

		<p>Mary Coyne was the housekeeper at Clayton after the Fricks moved to New York City. She may have been the servant who greeted guests during Miss Frick's debut.</p>
		<p>Miss Coyne was born around 1860 in Ireland and immigrated to the United States in 1880. She likely began working for the Fricks in the late 1880s; her name appears on payroll records from the early 1890s. She first worked as a maid at Clayton, making $17.75 per month. She remained at Clayton after the Fricks moved to New York and was eventually promoted to housekeeper, a position she held through the 1920s. Records show that in December 1908 she was earning $30 per month. She died in 1933.</p>

It reminded Miss Frick of her late sister, Martha, who swallowed a pin when she was 2 and died in 1891 at age 5 of peritonitis and septicemia.</p>

		<p>For a Gilded Age woman, getting dressed was an elaborate process requiring layers of undergarments. The corset was a standard garment, critical to achieving the small-waisted look popular in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Corsets were made from cotton or from silk, lace, and other decorative but strong fabrics, with stays made of whalebone or steel stitched between the layers. No woman would leave the house without a tightly laced corset such as this one, which belonged to Mrs. Frick.</p>

		<p>Henry Frick relentlessly criticized Childs Frick, his only son and Helen's older brother. When Childs was sent away to a day school in Cambridge, Mass., Frick moved Helen's seat at the dinner table to where Childs used to sit. When Mrs. Frick managed to persuade her husband to let Childs come home and attend Shady Side Academy, Childs bullied Helen. He liked to make her cry, then force her to look in the mirror and admit she was ugly. Even Carnegie noticed, remarking in a letter to Frick, "Wish we had Helen up here (in Scotland) away from Childs." By 1908 Childs had graduated from Princeton University. He is mentioned nowhere in the records about Helen's debut and seems not to have attended.</p>

			<p>High society held parties during the winter and summer "seasons." The winter season began in mid-November and ended in February. Debutante coming out parties traditionally took place in December, as Helen's did. 
After Helen's debut party, many other parties were given in her honor in Pittsburgh, including bridge parties, dinner dances and cotillions at Pittsburgh's then most exclusive venue, the Pittsburgh Golf Club. One newspaper reported parties for every hour of every day for two weeks that Christmas season. A day might include skating in the morning, a luncheon, tea, a reception, and a dinner, dance or theater in the evening.</p>
